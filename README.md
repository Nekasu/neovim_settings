# This Folder is for saving my neovim settings.

The original folder is at ~/.config/, named nvim at YuHui-4090-Server. Its owner is zxt.

If you want to recover the noevim settings, plz move the folder '/mnt/sda/zxt/1_extensions/nvim_settins/nvim'  to '~/.config/', and rename the folder into nvim.

autoload文件夹中的文件为下载nvim插件的工具「VimPlug」
